## Description
PDF-installer is a command-line program written in C# that allows you to install and uninstall PDF files for later use.
But here's the catchâ€”it's intentionally written with messy and inefficient code as a joke!

## Features
- Install a specified PDF file
- Uninstall a previously installed PDF file
- Launch installed PDF files using the provided command

## Usage (If You Dare)

Install a specified PDF file.
```pdf install <file_path>```

Uninstall a previously installed PDF file.
```pdf uninstall <filename>```

Display help for the command.
```pdf --help```

## Installation

To install the project using either wget or curl, follow the steps below:

**Copy and paste the following command if you have `curl` installed:**
```shell
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felix068/PDF-installer/main/Install.sh)"
```

**Alternatively, if you have `wget` installed, use the following command:**
```shell
sudo bash -c "bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felix068/PDF-installer/main/Install.sh)"
```
## Note

To launch an installed PDF file, use the "pdf_" prefix followed by the file name (with no file extention). Or just cross your fingers and hope it works. Good luck!
